# Driving dashboard - fun with d3.js

Weekend fun to mashup driving data with Leaflet.js and d3.js.

**Demo: [pippinlee.com/driving-dashboard](http://pippinlee.com/driving-dashboard/)**

Clicking the "drive" car button animates the driving path and charts.

#### Uses:

* [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) for the mapping <3 with help from [openplans](https://github.com/openplans/Leaflet.AnimatedMarker) animation plugin
* [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) for the line charts
* Driving data from a sushi trip 🍣


Mapping is done in main.js. Charts are done in graph.js.
